This little app is a rewrite of the same Burger Builder app I wrote awhile ago which was using AngularJS, HTMl5, and Bootstrap. Other build tools were grunt and bower.

I replace it with ReactJS, Redux, React-Boostrap, Babel for ES6. Build tools are web-pack, and yarn. Yarn is a tool to manage npm packages. I found it easier to use than npm

The test module for this app will be added later.

Things I learn from making this app:
- ReactJS components: Functional components & class components
- Type checking for React Components
- JSX syntax
- ES6: modules, export, const / let, Array new methods, arrow functions
- Redux: store, state, binding React components to the redux store
- Actions / reducers
- React-Bootraps
- Using factory function to make Component classes of the same behavior and properties
